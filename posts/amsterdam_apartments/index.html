        <p>In this post I attempt to explain what I learnt when dipping my toes in purchasing a house in the Netherlands. I will take two avenues to explore this topic. 1. What did I learn about the house buying process in the Netherlands: how did I learn these things, what were useful resources etc. 2. What did I learn about myself in this process?</p>
<p>Other open questions I&rsquo;d like to muse on are: when does it make sense to get a mortgage? Is investing in real estate in developed western countries a good idea?</p>

</h3>
<p>Answering 1. I will begin by providing important context. As of this writing, the Dutch government provides tax incentives for mortgage holders. This link provides more information: <a href="https://www.viisi-expats.nl/mortgages/tax-deductible-mortgage-interest/">https://www.viisi-expats.nl/mortgages/tax-deductible-mortgage-interest/</a>. The basic fact to know is that you can deduct interest rate payments from your taxable income, which makes the effective interest rate of a mortgage lower. Secondarily, the Netherlands has something called the ‘30 percent ruling’ which allows skilled expats satisfying certain criteria to pay less tax. These two facts mean that there are a number of wealthy expats in the Netherlands looking to get a mortgage.</p>
<h3 id="buyers-agents">
  Buyer&rsquo;s agents
  <a class="heading-link" href="#buyers-agents">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>As a consequence, there exist ‘aankoopmakelaars’ (buyer’s agents) which take a fee for assisting with a housing search. My understanding is these most cater to expats (in fact, some even have ‘expat’ in their company name). The payment model of most of these is ‘no-cure, no-pay’ and they charge a fixed fee. (Search r/Netherlands or r/NetherlandsHousing for more information on ‘aankoopmakelaars’ and their role/necessity in the process. I recall reading an article about price fixing between buying and selling agents, but cannot dig this up again, so be wary).</p>
<p>The ‘aankoopmakelaar’ does the necessary-but-annoying stuff in the house buying process. One important note is that they will not source properties for you: that is, you will have to do all the searching through Funda.nl, identifying apartments that are of interest to you, and sending them to your buyer’s agent. They will schedule viewings for you (and try to attend those viewings if they can).</p>
<p>TODO: biotechnical inspection, bidding process, places to look for guides for this (i.e. reddit)</p>

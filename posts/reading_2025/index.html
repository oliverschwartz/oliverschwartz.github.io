Narnie (lev, satnik, a carodenica) (CS Lewis) [C]
Superintelligence [C]

Quite an academic text. Given it was published in 2014 and how rapidly AI seems to move, I didn&rsquo;t find the book to be dated at all. There were many interesting ideas in here. Most of the arguments were not premised on AI looking a particular way or taking a particular form, but were quite general. My general takeaway was that the existential risk posed by AI is not vastly overlooked, and the problem should be treated in a similar fashion as the problem of nuclear weapons. One interesting focus of the early part of the book was predicting the form of a &rsquo;takeoff&rsquo;: how rapidly AI may radically change human life.


The code book [C]

This was a highly entertaining and informative read. There was sufficient technical explanation of topics like asymmetric cryptography that I felt like I was reading a textbook, rather than something more pop-science-y. There was broad historical coverage, from ancient Greece to Mary Queen of Scots to quantum information. Alongside technical explanations were anecdotes about the various significant figures in cryptography: Alan Turing, the folks behind RSA, the various GCHQ employees who independently thought up many ideas in symmetric and asymmetric cryptography.


American Kingpin [C]

An easy but entertaining read. It did a good job capturing the speed at which the Silk Road took off. The author didn&rsquo;t lionize nor vilify Ross Ulbricht, but tried to present the evolution of the Silk Road as a natural progression of the ideologies which interested him during university. I was a little dissatisfied that there was no exploration of crypto laundering techniques.


The power of habit [C] (garbage self help)
Sentient [IP]

An eye opening read covering a broad spectrum of species of which I had never heard.

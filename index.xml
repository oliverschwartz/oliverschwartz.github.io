      <title>Year of Slovak</title>

      <description>After putting 6 months of consistent (daily) effort into learning Dutch, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus my attention on Slovak. Through learning Dutch, I have learned an incredible amount about how I can teach myself a language (as well as the Dutch itself, of course). My objective is to study 60 minutes every day for a year, and to assess myself along the way. I intend this post to serve as documentation for my progression.</description>

      <title>Purchasing property in the Netherlands</title>

      <description>In this post I attempt to explain what I learnt when dipping my toes in purchasing a house in the Netherlands. I will take two avenues to explore this topic. 1. What did I learn about the house buying process in the Netherlands: how did I learn these things, what were useful resources etc. 2. What did I learn about myself in this process?
Other open questions I&amp;rsquo;d like to muse on are: when does it make sense to get a mortgage?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll begin with some important information. I live in the Netherlands. As a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to learn Dutch. Learning a foreign language is a very interesting and rewarding experience which I highly recommend to others. To that end, the objective of this post is to collate some concrete ideas and practices to help motivated language students.
The &amp;lsquo;meta&amp;rsquo; stuff    How should one think about learning a foreign language?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading a book written by Chris Allen on Haskell - Haskell Programming from First Principles. This is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone interested in functional programming. More and more I am learning to appreciate how wonderful functional programming can be. Strict typing makes a lot of simple bugs evaporate. The module structure of Haskell is also simple. Typeclasses are a far more elegant way of specifying behaviour than the convolutions of Java&amp;rsquo;s interfaces (at least, I find them more intuitive).</description>

      <description>Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been reading about mathematical finance and all the interesting problems therein. In doing so, I some interesting albeit simple framings of option properties.
Options    An option is a derivative product which gives the holder the option (but not the obligation) to purchase some asset at a fixed price on a fixed date. (This is a European option - American options allow you to exercise the option on any preceding day.</description>

      <description>I came across this probability problem in an MIT course and I thought the solution was a good illustration of the memoryless property of some distributions.
The problem: Suppose you are at a bank. You find that all three tellers are busy serving other customers, and there are no other customers in the queue. Assume that the service times for you and for each of the customers being served are i.</description>

      <description>Suppose we have the following two functions:
 $y = a^x$ $x = a^y$  You are told that there is one intersection point. Find this intersection point and the corresponding value of $a$.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin by rearranging the second function to get it in terms of $y$: $$ y = \log_a x = \frac{\ln x}{\ln a} $$
Let&amp;rsquo;s define another function, $f(x)$, do be the difference between these two functions: $ f(x) = a^x - \frac{\ln x}{\ln a}.</description>

      <title>The maiden post: the singular value decomposition</title>

      <description>Singular value decomposition    Singular value decomposition (SVD) is perhaps the most interesting and fundamental theorem of linear algebra. Generally speaking, it says that any matrix can be factored into the product of three matrices with specific properties, one of which is a diagonal matrix. (In this post we will just assume our matrices are real-valued).
Specifically, the SVD of a real matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ can be written as the product of three matrices $U$, $\Sigma$, $V^T.</description>

      <description>I am a software engineer and problem solver from Sydney, Australia.
As an undergrad, I studied at Princeton University, majoring in computer science. I also rowed on the men&amp;rsquo;s heavyweight crew team. At Princeton, I won the Shapiro prize for academic excellence and the 1916 cup for the varsity athlete with highest academic standing. I was the president of Tau Beta Pi (the engineering honor society) and graduated Summa Cum Laude (3.</description>

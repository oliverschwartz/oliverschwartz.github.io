    <p>I am a software engineer and problem solver from Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>As an undergrad, I studied at <strong>Princeton University</strong>, majoring in computer science. I also rowed on the men&rsquo;s heavyweight crew team. At Princeton, I won the Shapiro prize for academic excellence and the 1916 cup for the varsity athlete with highest academic standing. I was the president of Tau Beta Pi (the engineering honor society) and graduated Summa Cum Laude (3.96 GPA). My academic work at Princeton was covered many topics in computer science, with focuses on machine learning, distributed systems, and computing applications in high frequency markets.</p>
<p>In the past, I have worked with <a href="https://www.skoposlabs.com/"><strong>Skopos Labs</strong></a> - an investment firm leveraging machine learning and natural language processing. At Skopos, I worked on building a back-testing framework, signal generation and optimization, and full-stack development on a client-facing platform. I have also interned with <a href="https://www.bridgewater.com/"><strong>Bridgewater</strong></a>, a macro hedge fund based in Connecticut. I will be starting as an investment engineer at Bridgewater in September 2021.</p>
<p>I am interested in many different topics spanning math, engineering, and statistics. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been tackling problems in mathematical finance using tools from linear algebra and stochastic calculus.
